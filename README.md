# Kubernetes Info

This is a very short and very incomplete overview of Kubernetes intended to be used internally for ITC Members of the [S.P.E.L.L Projekt](https://spell-plattform.de/) of the DRK Landesverband Rheinland Pfalz e.V.. This only contains the most basic of information which should however be enough to be able to manage non complex Kubernetes Instances.
